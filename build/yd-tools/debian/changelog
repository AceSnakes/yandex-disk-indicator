yd-tools (1.5.1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Changes:
   -- Most of code refactored with OOP concept (to simplify future code support)
   -- Big optimization of config reading facility
   -- Debugging output (inherited from grive-tools) changed to standard logging module (allows to use several levels of messages output and can be configured to save messages to file)
